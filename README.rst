Collaborate
-----------

* **Developing** You can take the last code from the repository and experiment with it. When you're done, you can send us a "Merge request". 

* **Documenting** Right now the documentation is a bit insufficient. If you want to document e-cidadania, feel free to do it. We use Sphinx (1.0.7) to generate the documents.

* **Translating** e-cidadania achieves to be international. If you want to translate it to your language just follow the steps in the documentation an send your catalog to us, we will include it ASAP.

* **Bug reporting** You can report the bugs you find in the application in this trac, though the users are not allowed to register, so if you want to use it, ask us for an account at soporte @ ecidadania.org with the subject "e-cidadania trac account" and we will generate an account for you :).
