Deployment
==========

Apache 2
--------

.. note:: This section is still on development.

nginx + uWSGI
-------------

.. note:: The installation through uwsgi works for other servers, not just nginx,
          since it's uWSGI who executes the e-cidadania instance while the server
          just serves the static content.

.. warning:: This section is still on development.

DreamHost
---------

The instructions for deployment on a DreamHost shared server are too extensive
to include here. You can find them in the `Oscar Carballal blog <http://blog.oscarcp.com>`_
