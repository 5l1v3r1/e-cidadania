Deployment
==========

Apache 2
--------

.. note:: This section is still on development.

nginx + FastCGI
---------------

.. note:: The installation through FastCGI should work for other server types, since
          FastCGI is the one who executes e-cidadania while the server just serves
          the static content.

.. warning:: This section is still on development.

DreamHost
---------

The instructions for deployment on a DreamHost shared server are too extensive
to include here. You can find them in the `Oscar Carballal blog <http://blog.oscarcp.com>`_
